- [ ] Resolve todos
- [ ] Add how to calculate std dev, covariance, and correlation coefficient [link](https://byjus.com/jee/correlation-coefficient/)
- [ ] Revise how to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues for a matrix

- [ ] Refine lecture write-up to text
  - [ ] Add orbit cards
 Â - [ ] Do recommended readings to fill up details
- [ ] Go through [further material](/iaml-revision-plan#further-material) for deeper understanding of material

- [ ] Go through each lab
- [ ] Go through each tutorial

Gaussian mixture models: class notes from thurs 4/11/21 -> exercise after 14min
  - Check errata for the lecture, changes formula!
    - The case for when it's not only in a 2d space
    - if we have k models, p(class_k) = 1/k for random first assignment
      - Then need to update it
  - $|\Sigma|$ denotes the determinant of the covariance matrix -> have a Python script ready which computes the determinant for you
