This is a compendium of the courses I have taken in the past years or am taking at the moment at Edinburgh Uni.

Most of these notes are written for my future self, for revision. That's why my note-taking style is best described with "not concise but overexplained"; I want to increase the chance of re-learning material by just reading it and having a lot of contextâ€”you might find this approach not as useful as I do.

I categorised all notes using two factors: `course` and `noteType`. For the first category, I use [acronyms](course-overview). The note types are self-explanatory.

Use the filter function in the sidebar (`cmd + b`) to see only notes you're interested in.

This is a prototyype, I don't know yet what this website will turn out to be eventually, some ideas are plotted on my [roadmap]().

Most of my notes use images, especially if there are mathematical expressions which would be difficult to type in LaTeX. However, if you are a visually impaired person and cannot read the content from these images, please do [reach out to me](www.ericjanto.com/contact) so that we can find a solution.

Lastly, if you find a mistake, I'd like to encourage you to [open an issue on GitHub](dummy-link).
