Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is [Eric Janto](https://ericjanto.com) and I'm an AI & CS student at the University of Edinburgh. This is a compendium of the courses I have taken in the past years or am taking at the moment.

Most of these notes are written for my future self, in case I forget some of the content. That's why I went for a "not concise but overexplained" approach; I want to be able to understand something by just reading it. Using my own words for the explanations helps me a lot â€” but you might not find this approach as useful as I do.

I categorised all notes using two factors: `course` and `noteType`. For the first category, I use [acronyms](course-overview). So `Introductory Applied Machine Learning` becomes `IAML`. The note types are self-explanatory.

Use the filter function in the sidebar to see only notes you're interested in.

Lastly, if you find a mistake, I'd like to encourage you to [open an issue on GitHub](dummy-link).

Eric
