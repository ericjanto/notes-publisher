This is a compendium of the courses I have taken in the past years or am taking at the moment at Edinburgh Uni.

Most of these notes are written for my future self, for revision. That's why my note-taking style is best described with "not concise but overexplained"; I want to increase the chance of re-learning material by just reading it and having a lot of context‚Äîyou might find this approach not as useful as I do.

I categorised all notes using two factors: `course` and `noteType`. For the first category, I use [acronyms](course-overview). The note types are self-explanatory.

Use the filter function in the sidebar (`cmd + b`) to see only notes you're interested in.

This is a prototyype, I don't know yet what this website will turn out to be eventually, some ideas are plotted on my [roadmap]().

Lastly, if you find a mistake, I'd like to encourage you to [open an issue on GitHub](dummy-link).

- [ ] Latex display mode: margin top and bottom, and centered
- [ ] Disable auto-subtitle from meta title for images
- [ ] Host on subdomain (netlify branch subdomains, maybe via git submodules?)

- [ ] Github issue link (in about + 404 page)
- [ ] Roadmap link

- [ ] More spacing for katex display blocks
- [ ] Transfer latex require to gatsby-browser

### Roadmap for Notes
- [ ] Include orbit: https://docs.withorbit.com/
- [ ] Add srs system to entire notes (not read in‚Ä¶ label + coloured & sorted in sidebar respectively)
- [ ] Add backlinks -> could have different directory where you use [[]] and then tool creates new md files with the links in the frontmatter. Tool could also add randomised slugs! And then, use new zettel template to utilise markdown front matter field
- [ ] Bullet points like in roam research
- [ ] Make it generically usable -> not static, can edit from website, account system etc.
  - This may require a redesign of the system architecture
- [ ] [Native Anki support](https://pypi.org/project/AnkiServer/)?
- [ ] Could highlight notes / text and then click on ‚Äúcreate flashcard‚Äù
	- Can click on ‚Äúshow cards‚Äù
	- Highlight corresponding text if hover on card / card active
