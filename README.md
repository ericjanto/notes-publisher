This is a compendium of the courses I have taken in the past years or am taking at the moment at Edinburgh Uni.

Most of these notes are written for my future self, in case I forget some of the content. That's why I went for a "not concise but overexplained" approach; I want to increase the chance of re-learning material by just reading it â€” you might not find this approach as useful as I do.

I categorised all notes using two factors: `course` and `noteType`. For the first category, I use [acronyms](course-overview). The note types are self-explanatory.

Use the filter function in the sidebar to see only notes you're interested in.

I don't know yet what this website will turn out to be eventually, some ideas are plotted on my [roadmap]().

Lastly, if you find a mistake, I'd like to encourage you to [open an issue on GitHub](dummy-link).
